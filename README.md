# DocumentationForAppleHosts
Apple's host documentation is very vague: (https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210060)

All Apple devices will call many hostnames while they are connected to the internet and there is little documentation letting us know what they are for and what they do.

The goal with this project is to document all the domains that are called on various Apple devices and figure out what they do.
